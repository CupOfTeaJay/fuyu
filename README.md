# Hachiya

Hachiya is an attempt to provide a mechanism for natively modifying a Bevy
application. Meaning, as an alternative to incorporating a scripting engine, one
may "hook" their game into source-available and/or pre-built Rust libraries.
This crate is a work-in-progress (and quite nascent at that). API changes and
general instability should therefore be expected throughout the course of its 
development.
